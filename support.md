# 1. Installer Problems
### 1.1 Is the mod manager a virus?
BitDefender and other AV software seem to have added the Mod Manager into their database of suspicious programs. See this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/beat-saber-modding-group/BeatSaberModInstaller/issues/20) for more info, and use your best judgement.

### 1.2 I can't download the mod manager, or it closes as soon as I start it up
Make sure you're using the one from the [BSMG GitHub](https://github.com/beat-saber-modding-group/BeatSaberModInstaller/releases/latest). There are 3 releases being distributed due to concerns about how different AV software blocks the application:
* BeatSaberModManager-Unbundled.zip
* BeatSaberModManager.exe
* BeatSaberModManagerClassic.exe
Take your pick, they all work the same way.
