## Assistant
The original Support - Assistant took over the #support channel in the earilest days and answered everyone's questions back when no one else would. They've since moved on to creating resources to help people, like ModelSaber: a repository for custom avatars, sabers, platforms; as well as ModAssistant: the currently recommended mod installer.

## Balsa (retired)
BeatSaver creator - he's the reason we have somewhere to get our custom songs in the first place. He shows up in once in awhile to show off BeatSaver numbers, call us nerds, and present his collection of finely aged memes. He's since stepped down from the staff team but we wouldn't be here without him.
**Contributions:** BeatSaver Creator.
