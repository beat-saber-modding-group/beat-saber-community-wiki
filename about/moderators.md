## BeigeAnimal
We had to whip this boy into a bit of shape but he's now one of the most effective moderators. He's not really specialized in any field but he's willing to lend a helping **provided they ask in the right channel.** Also hates sketchfab links.

## RangeValley
"My dad worked for years as an admin, but he got laid off when bots took over. He came home that night and told me we had to move into the van, since we couldn't afford rent anymore, then he beat the shit out of me with jumper cables. Shitposting should be legal."

## Sam
He's either talking about Steven or being way too patriotic in chat (BS Nordic Admin btw). Don't call him cute, he hates that. He also makes maps, check them out below.
