# Ready to Map?
**Have you…**
1. [Downloaded Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) and chosen a [map editor](/mapping#map-editing-resources)?
2. [Set up our audio file](/mapping/basic-audio) to confirm your bpm and make sure you’ve got a good intro/outro?
3. [Exported](/mapping/basic-audio#exporting) your song file as an OGG?
# The Essentials
Before you can even think about mapping, you need to understand the basics.
## Map Files
Regardless of what editor you choose to map with, every map needs:

* **Song File:** OGG format, you much have this ready before you can map
* **Cover Image:** JPG or PNG, must be perfectly square between 256 and 512 pixels per side. You much have this before you can release your map
* **Info File:** All of the metadata for your map as a whole. Things in this file apply to ALL difficulties (i.e., song name, artist name, mapper name, song file name, cover image name, etc.). This is automatically created by your editor.
* **Difficulty Files:** One per difficulty in your map. Things in this file apply to just the one difficulty (i.e., note placement, light placement, note jump speed, etc.). This is automatically created by your editor.

When you’re ready to prepare your song for upload you must have a minimum of four files.
## Block Types
Directional Blocks | Dot Blocks | Bombs | Walls
-------------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------------
Image 1 | Image 2 | Image 3 | Image 4
Contents 1 | Contents 2 | Contents 3 | Contents 4
## Block Distribution
As a *very general* rule of thumb for new mappers, blocks should be distributed roughly as follows:

* 60-80% on the bottom row
* 10% or less on the top row
* The rest on the middle row

For more on row usage in different difficulties, see Gauging Difficulty.

>If you’re using [Mediocre Mapper](/mapping/mediocre-mapper) as your editor you can hit <kbd>SHIFT+TAB</kbd> to open the error checker then click “Stat Panel” to see this breakdown.

>Certain styles of maps (like dance maps) will have a higher percentage of blocks on the top row but always remember to consider your target audience and their comfort.
