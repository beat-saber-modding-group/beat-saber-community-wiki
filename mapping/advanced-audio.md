# Checking Audio Quality
Generally, as a rule, always use **WAV(E) or FLAC (lossless uncompressed or compressed)** files as sources for your songs. This is because **lossy formats like MP3, AAC or OGG always lose information when converted to their formats** and cannot be restored by 'un-converting'. This is why you should never use your exported OGG-file to make new edits to your audio. Therefore, always use a lossless source file, if possible. However, some FLAC sources could be “up-converted” from lossy formats, so using a spectral analyser tool to check your audio file(s) before using them is a recommended practice.
Tip: Save your own lossless WAV(E) files when doing edits, at each step, so you always have a lossless source to continue editing from when you need to do edits.
