# Editor Setup
## Installation
1. Download MediocreMapper.exe from [GitHub](https://github.com/squeaksies/MediocreMapper/releases/latest) 
> Do not download Mediocre Mapper Server (mediocremapperserver.zip). This is a separate tool for mapping collaboration that is not covered on this page.
{.is-warning}
2. Unzip the file and place the .exe file wherever you like on your hard drive.
3. Double click `mediocremapper.exe` to run.
## First Time Setup
The first time you run MM you will need to direct it to the location of two folders: `CustomLevels` and `CustomWIPLevels`. You have several options available to you:
**If you have VR and Beat Saber:**
* Give MM the path to the two appropriate folders
* Steam Example: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomLevels`
* Oculus Example: `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomWIPLevels`

**If you do not have VR or Beat Saber OR have VR but donâ€™t have Beat Saber:**
* Make two folders called `CustomLevels` and `CustomWIPLevels`
* Example: `C:\Users\Helen\Documents\CustomWIPLevels`

All of your working map files will go into a song name folder within this CustomWIPLevels folder.

## Editor Settings
These core settings are all available from the MM home page when you first open the program. 
### Map Selection
The map selection pane has four tabs, each with songs listed alphabetically.
* **WIP Songs:** This tab contains all of the map folders saved in your `CustomIPLevels` folder. New maps are created here and are accessible in-game under "Custom WIP Levels."
* **Custom Songs:** This tab contains all the downloaded custom songs saved in your `CustomLevels` folder. Maps are accessible in-game under "Custom Levels."
* **Multi-Mapper:** This tab contains any maps being collboratively worked on via the *Mediocre Mapper Server.*
* **Temp Loader:** This tab allows you to temporarily "quick preview" zip files online (i.e., from #testplays, BeatSaver, or BeastSaber) without downloading and extracting them.

There are several functions available to you on this screen:
* The <kbd>Refresh Song List</kbd> button refreshes the songs listed.
* The <kbd>Edit</kbd> button next to a map opens it in MM. 
* The <kbd>Delete</kbd> button next to a map perma-deletes it. **Note:** Once deleted this way maps are gone forever and unrecoverable.
* The <kbd>Star</kbd> button next to a map favorites it, bumping it to the top of the list.
### Map Creation
Below the map selection pane you can create a new empty song folder in `CustomWIPLevels` by entering the desired name of your folder (typically Song Name or Artist - Song Name) then clicking <kbd>Create Level</kbd>.
### Settings
The settings pane includes global settings for autosaving, zip packaging, folder paths, and more.
* **Autosave Settings:** Autosave is enabled by default at an interval of 300 seconds (5 minutes). This is generally fine for most users unless you are doing a light-heavy map. Autosave while playing the song in the editor is also enabled by default.
* **Mapping & Lighting Settings:** 
* - No lighting is off by default, meaning that the lighting track will be visible to the right of the mapping track. Check to hide the lighting track.
* - You have the option to provide MM with an alternate folder to save your packaged songs. By default the packaged song will be found in the same folder where the uncompressed map lives.
* **Beta Settings:** If you have the Mapping Extensions mod installed you will have additional checkboxes enabled for "extended" mapping features like precision placement, precision rotation, and six-lane. New mappers are encouraged to skip this until they're more comfortable with the basics.
* **Legacy Settings:** If you have the ChromaToggle mod installed you can check this box to enable the game modes but it has been unsupported for some time.
* **Other Settings:** Click the <kbd>Clear Settings</kbd> button to revert to default settings. You may also enter new paths for either of your song folders. If for some reason nothing works you can click the <kbd>Everything Inexplicably Broken?<kbd> button to delete your MM config file.
