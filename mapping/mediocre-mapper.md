# Editor Setup
## Installation
1. Download MediocreMapper.exe from [GitHub](https://github.com/squeaksies/MediocreMapper/releases/latest) 
> Do not download Mediocre Mapper Server (mediocremapperserver.zip). This is a separate tool for mapping collaboration that is not covered on this page.
{.is-warning}
2. Unzip the file and place the .exe file wherever you like on your hard drive.
3. Double click `mediocremapper.exe` to run.
## First Time Setup
The first time you run MM you will need to direct it to the location of two folders: `CustomLevels` and `CustomWIPLevels`. You have several options available to you:
**If you have VR and Beat Saber:**
* Give MM the path to the two appropriate folders
* Steam Example: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomLevels`
* Oculus Example: `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomWIPLevels`

**If you do not have VR or Beat Saber OR have VR but donâ€™t have Beat Saber:**
* Make two folders called `CustomLevels` and `CustomWIPLevels`
* Example: `C:\Users\Helen\Documents\CustomWIPLevels`

All of your working map files will go into a song name folder within this CustomWIPLevels folder.
