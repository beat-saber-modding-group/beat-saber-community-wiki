# Editor Setup
## Installation
1. Download MediocreMapper.exe from [GitHub](https://github.com/squeaksies/MediocreMapper/releases/latest) 
> Do not download Mediocre Mapper Server (mediocremapperserver.zip). This is a separate tool for mapping collaboration that is not covered on this page.
{.is-warning}
2. Unzip the file and place the .exe file wherever you like on your hard drive.
3. Double click `mediocremapper.exe` to run.
## First Time Setup
The first time you run MM you will need to direct it to the location of two folders: `CustomLevels` and `CustomWIPLevels`. You have several options available to you:
**If you have VR and Beat Saber:**
* Give MM the path to the two appropriate folders
* Steam Example: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomLevels`
* Oculus Example: `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomWIPLevels`

**If you do not have VR or Beat Saber OR have VR but donâ€™t have Beat Saber:**
* Make two folders called `CustomLevels` and `CustomWIPLevels`
* Example: `C:\Users\Helen\Documents\CustomWIPLevels`

All of your working map files will go into a song name folder within this CustomWIPLevels folder.

## Editor Settings
### Map Selection
The map selection pane has four tabs, each with songs listed alphabetically.
* **WIP Songs:** This tab contains all of the map folders saved in your `CustomIPLevels` folder. New maps are created here and are accessible in-game under "Custom WIP Levels."
* **Custom Songs:** This tab contains all the downloaded custom songs saved in your `CustomLevels` folder. Maps are accessible in-game under "Custom Levels."
* **Multi-Mapper:** This tab contains any maps being collboratively worked on via the *Mediocre Mapper Server.*
* **Temp Loader:** This tab allows you to temporarily "quick preview" zip files online (i.e., from #testplays, BeatSaver, or BeastSaber) without downloading and extracting them.

There are several functions available to you on this screen:
* The <kbd>Refresh Song List</kbd> button refreshes the songs listed.
* The <kbd>Edit</kbd> button next to a map opens it in MM. 
* The <kbd>Delete</kbd> button next to a map perma-deletes it. **Note:** Once deleted this way maps are gone forever and unrecoverable.
* The <kbd>Star</kbd> button next to a map favorites it, bumping it to the top of the list.
### Map Creation
Below the map selection pane you can create a new empty song folder in `CustomWIPLevels` by entering the desired name of your folder (typically Song Name or Artist - Song Name) then clicking <kbd>Create Level</kbd>.
