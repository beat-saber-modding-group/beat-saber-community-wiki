# Mods
Many of these mods are available via the [ModSaber Installer](/beginners-guide#Modsaber-installer) and it is highly recommended to install them this way to avoid any mishaps. For the ones that aren't, refer to [FAQ](faq#how-do-i-load-other-plugins). Mods without a [Usage] link do not require or support any configuration.

This list may be outdated. Make sure to check that the plugin is compatible with your version of the game before trying to install it.

[Usage](https://github.com/brian91292/BeatSaber-DebrisRemover)
[Release](https://github.com/brian91292/BeatSaber-DebrisRemover/releases)

NOTE: Kyle1413 created the original Debris Remover, but decided to remove this plugin from modsaber, and also deleted the github repo.
The plugin was "fundamentally flawed" and "caused extremely hard to reproduce issues that were run ruining."
The plugin worked by setting the debris lifetime to 0, but this would somehow cause strange issue like the example below.
