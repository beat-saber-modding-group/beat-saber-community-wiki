## [Modders](https://bsmg.wiki/about/modders)

# Moderators
The Anti-Meme Dream Team! With a server so large, a lot of moderation is required to keep the channels clean and under control, and we have the moderation team to thank for that!

## BeigeAnimal
We had to whip this boy into a bit of shape but he's now one of the most effective moderators. He's not really specialized in any field but he's willing to lend a helping **provided they ask in the right channel.** Also hates sketchfab links.

## Monty (retired)
He's come a long way from the only user in the entire server that we accidentally banned not once, but *twice.*

## RangeValley
My dad worked for years as an admin, but he got laid off when bots took over. He came home that night and told me we had to move into the van, since we couldn't afford rent anymore, then he beat the shit out of me with jumper cables. Shitposting should be legal.
**Roles:** Moderator

# Staff
The team that runs the show at the forefront and behind the scenes. Whether it comes to project management, plugin approval, paying for the servers (RIP our wallets), event coordination, or many of the other secret projects, there's always lots of work to be done! The community wouldn't be around without the countless hours contributed by these incredible individuals, so please give them a virtual round of applause!

## Assistant
The original Support - Assistant took over the #support channel in the earilest days and answered everyone's questions back when no one else would. They've since moved on to creating resources to help people, like ModelSaber: a repository for custom avatars, sabers, platforms; as well as ModAssistant: the currently recommended mod installer.

BeatSaver creator - he's the reason we have somewhere to get our custom songs in the first place. He shows up in once in awhile to show off BeatSaver numbers, call us nerds, and present his collection of finely aged memes. He's since stepped down from the staff team but we wouldn't be here without him.

# Mappers
Each of your favorite maps is carefully crafted and tested over many hours by a talented mapper. As much as we'd love to include them here too, there are WAY too many of them. If you like someone's maps, give it a thumbs up in game, review it on [BeastSaber](https://bsaber.com), or tell them personally! They'll really appreciate it. If you ever want to commission a map, we encourage you to contact them in the [Beat Saber Commissions server!](https://discord.gg/4RbcH5G)
