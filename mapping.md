> Take these guides with a grain of salt! They're not the holy bible of mapping - a lot of these are still opinions. Not everyone's shares the same vocabulary either (what on earth is "drumsticking"?) My advice is to follow these rules until you're comfortable with your skills, and then get creative, experiment and innovate!

## Ranking Criteria
Maps that are ranked and worth PP need to adhere to the [ScoreSaber Ranking Critera](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mtVihRO1LomyptXayoDNDTQYgX_TQPp6ZYDmtwR2jMI/edit). To learn more about the ranking process, visit the [ScoreSaber Discord](https://discord.gg/WpuDMwU).

# Publishing Songs
When you're ready to release your map to the public, upload it to https://beatsaver.com.

Please** do not** upload WIPs to BeatSaver! It's hard to tell which maps aren't finished in game, and anyone who plays your WIP without practice mode will create a new leaderboard for that map. Uploading to BeatSaver should be akin to putting it on store shelves - that is, it's your final product. To share for playtesting, we encourage you to use the #testplays channel in the discord and get feedback to improve your map!

# Editors
Most custom maps are being made using the community built map editors.

> Currently, the community editors use a different format than the official one. The formats will be unified in the future, but the community editors don't support the official format and thus community-made songs cannot be loaded using the native game song loader yet. To convert your map into a format that the game and BeatSaver will recognize, use [Songe Converter](https://github.com/lolPants/songe-converter).
{.is-warning}

## Mediocre Mapper
This is the editor used by the vast majority of the community. It is recommended to use either this or the official editor to make custom maps.
https://github.com/squeaksies/MediocreMapper/releases/latest

> The __vast majority__ of the community uses this editor, because it's by far the most feature rich and most recently updated. However, this is still first and foremost squeaksies' personal editor. 
> It's filled to the brim with memes and inside jokes, and he doesn't give a flying heck what you think about it. You have been warned!

## MIDI Converter / Web Based Editor
MIDI converter made by ciwolsey!
This editor relies on MIDI data to outline a beatmap, then that track can be edited in the companion web editor.

## Unofficial 2D Track Editor
A 2D track editor made in Processing by Megalon!
https://github.com/megalon/BeatSaber-UnofficialTrackEditor/releases

> Note: This is depreciated and there is very little support for this program, if any!

## THE OSU! EDITOR
You can use the osu! editor to help you with timing when creating your map. Here is a video tutorial by Fayhe

## BPM Saber
Elliotttate's tool for finding the BPM of a song
https://bsaber.com/bpmsaber/

# Legacy Tools
These tools have been deprecated by MediocreMapper, but you might find these helpful if you are using older tools.

## BPM Changer
A [tool](https://github.com/zevdg/bpm-saber) for changing the BPM of a beatsaber track without changing the position of the boxes and walls relative to the music.

## VARIABLE BPM
Currently variable BPM isn't supported by the game, but you can fake it by offsetting notes to fit the grid. TehSuperToilet made a guide on how to do this. [It is included in this zip file.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/443569023951568906/459771392054001664/bpm_changer.zip)

## Copy-Paste Lighting Guide
Normally, lighting events cannot be copy pasted but this [tutorial](https://bsaber.com/copy-and-paste-lighting-events-in-editsaber/) should make things easier.

# "Mappers" role on the Beat Saber Modding Group Discord
If you'd like to apply for the Mappers role on the Beat Saber Modding Group Discord, use the following google form.
https://goo.gl/forms/KM71UKjQpbCesWNg2
You will be contacted when your application is looked at, but due to the limited staff and higher priority tasks to get to, the wait could be long.

# Frequently Asked Questions
## Do I need Beat Saber installed to use the editors?
No. The editor will ask for the Beat Saber directory, but it can be any folder.

## What if I want to make my own editor / converter?
Understanding the track JSON file: https://pastebin.com/cTPGrxWY
Understanding the events data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vCTlDvx0ZW8NkkZBYW6ecvXaVRxDUKX7QIoah9PCp_c/htmlview
Example track file: https://pastebin.com/rkZVSmte

## Where are custom maps saved?
Custom maps are saved to the `CustomSongs` folder in your Beat Saber install folder.
**Where is Beat Saber installed?** See [install folder.](faq/install-folder)

## "Your audio file name is wrong" message in the editor
The 3D Editor only supports `.ogg` files. You have to convert your file to Ogg Vorbis using a converter, such as [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).
If you simply change the file extension to `.ogg`, it will not work.

## How do I delay a song so that it doesn't start right when the level loads?
Currently this isn't possible in Beat Saber or the editors. For now you have to edit the song in an audio editor *(such as Audacity)* to add silence at the beginning of the track.
Check out [Kolezan's Song/Audio Editing Guide](https://bsaber.com/custom-mapping-song-audio-editing/) for instructions.

## I'm having issues uploading the map to BeatSaver, it says the format is invalid but everything looks right.
If you have Windows file extensions turned off, then you might have unknowingly saved your files with names like `cover.jpg.jpg`.  To turn off file extensions in Windows, see the following image:
![File Extensions](/uploads/images/file-extensions.png "File Extensions")

## I want to double the BPM of my song, is there an easy way to do that?
Here is a [Python3 Script](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/442372806705938434/447910905972523008/beat-saber-time-multiplier.zip) that will multiply the BPM and `_time` values in your JSON file by any given factor.
