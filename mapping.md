# Mapping Quick Start
Go from thinking about mapping to releasing your first map by following this checklist.
> Additional links from this checklist to essential information are coming *very* soon. Check back often as we continue to build this out!
{.is-warning}
- [ ] Download the necessary tools for mapping: an [audio editor](https://www.audacityteam.org/) and a [map editor](/mapping/#map-editing-resources).
- [ ] [Set up your audio file](https://bsaber.com/custom-mapping-song-audio-editing/) (courtesy of Kolezan) including finding and confirming the BPM and exporting to OGG format. 
- [ ] Set up your first song in your mapping editor (steps vary by which editor you choose).
- [ ] Get mapping! Review [Basic Mapping practices](/mapping/#tutorials-and-references) before you start. [Playtest](/mapping/#playtesting) your own work early and often while mapping.
- [ ] Get lighting! Review [Basic Lighting information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wpZgBeOD1-UbJpXf-b6gX5ICNYygCd6UK6LOPm-t5QM/edit) (courtesy of Puds). Simple manual lighting is easier than you think!
- [ ] Get your map [playtested](/mapping/#playtesting)! Third-party playtesting via the BSMG Discord is highly recommended to get constructive feedback and to get past your own “map blindness.”
- [ ] Once your song has been mapped, lighted, and playtested you’re ready to [release](/mapping/#publishing-songs) your song to the world on Beat Saver.

> Take these guides with a grain of salt! They're not the holy bible of mapping - a lot of these are still opinions. Not everyone's shares the same vocabulary either (what on earth is "drumsticking"?) My advice is to follow these rules until you're comfortable with your skills, and then get creative, experiment and innovate!

## Ranking Criteria
Maps that are ranked and worth PP need to adhere to the [ScoreSaber Ranking Critera](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mtVihRO1LomyptXayoDNDTQYgX_TQPp6ZYDmtwR2jMI/edit). To learn more about the ranking process, visit the [ScoreSaber Discord](https://discord.gg/WpuDMwU).

# Map Editing Resources
There are both official and community-developed editors available and preference is highly personal and frequently shifting as new official and community-developed tools come and go.
## Community Editors
Community editors are often a source of innovation with a lot of beneficial quality of life features for mappers, and can be used by mappers without VR. However, they may also be incomplete, unstable, or unpredictable at times so use with caution.

### Mediocre Mapper
The most feature rich 3D editor used by the majority of the mapping community, now stripped of memes and all the fun stuff. RIP Bongo cat. Uses the new 2.0 song format. *No longer supported by the developer, direct questions to #mapping-discussion* [Mediocre Mapper Download](https://github.com/squeaksies/MediocreMapper/releases)
> There is a full "User Guide" page coming very soon on Mediocre Mapper Mk5, but until that's available here is Joetastic's [Mk5 Song Setup Tutorial](https://streamable.com/01we6) video to get you started.
{.is-info}
### BeatMapper.app
A new web-based 3D beat saber editor using the new 2.0 song format. Runs in the browser so it's platform agnostic. [BeatMapper Website](https://beatmapper.app/)
### EditSaber Enhanced
An older 3D map editor using the old 1.0 song format (maps must be converted before being playable). [EditSaber Enhanced Download](https://github.com/permissionBRICK/EditSaberEnhanced/releases)

## Official Editor 
The official editor is developed and supported by Beat Games and pre-installed with the Steam VR or Oculus PC versions of the game. It makes playtesting very convenient with one-click access to your work-in-progress in-game. The official editor is 2D and requires good visualization skills to translate well to a 3D play space, which can be challenging for new mappers. The vast majority of mappers use a [Community Editor](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping#community-editors).

* To access, launch the editor from within Beat Saber in your HMD or use fpfc launch parameters to open directly from your PC

# Playtesting
Testing your work is a critical part of mapping. Playing your own maps as you work helps you adjust for major playability issues and get a feel for your map. Third-party or “outside” playtesting is when someone other than yourself tests your pre-release map and provides constructive feedback and is helpful in highlighting issues to which you may be "map blind."
>You **do not** need to upload your map to Beat Saver in order for you or anyone else to test.
{.is-warning}

* If your map is using the 1.0 song format (your files are .json and .ogg) you must convert your map using one of several available tools like [Songe Converter](https://github.com/lolPants/songe-converter) by lolPants or [BeatMapper Tools](https://beatmappertools.com/index.php) by Darkuni.
* If your map is using the 2.0 song format (your files are .dat and .egg) you’re ready to test.

## Testing on a PC
Follow these steps to test any of your maps made with a community editor using PC-based VR.

1. If your WIP song folder isn’t already in Beat Saber_Data\CustomWIPLevels then place a copy there.
2. Access your map in-game via the CustomWIPLevels category in the bottom song pack menu.

## Testing on a Quest
Follow these steps to test any of your maps made with a community editor using an Oculus Quest. You must have [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com) and [BeatOn](https://bsaber.com/beaton/) installed.

1. Create a compressed .zip file of the individual song files (not the song folder).
2. Drag and drop the .zip file onto the BeatOn upload window.
3. Click “Sync to Beat Saber.”
4. Access your map in-game via the CustomWIPLevels category in the bottom song pack menu.

## Outside Testing
The #testplays channel in the Beat Saber Modding Group discord makes it easy to have your work checked by knowledgeable mappers. Playtesters will provide constructive feedback on how to improve your map in either video or text format in the #mapping-discussion channel.

1. Create a compressed .zip file of the individual song files (not the song folder).
2. Upload your map to #testplays using the following format:
**Map:** The name and artist of your map
**Length:** The length of the song
**BPM:** The BPM of the song
**Difficulty:** Which difficulties are included
**Feedback:** Any requests for feedback (specific difficulties to be tested, things to look for etc.)
**Status:** What state is the map in? (i.e., First draft complete, no lights; 1:45 mapped; release candidate w/ lighting; etc.)
3. Testers will usually look at your map within 24-48 hours and will use a number of reaction emojis (listed in #testplays pinned posts) to track testing status.

You can use the following code to copy and paste into Discord:
```
**Map:**
**Length:**
**BPM:**
**Difficulty:**
**Feedback:**
**Status:**
```
# Publishing Songs
One your song has been mapped, lighted, and playtested and it’s a finished product you’re ready to release it to the world on [BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com).

>Please **do not** upload an incomplete WIP map to BeatSaver. Anyone who plays your WIP without practice mode will create a new leaderboard for that map. See the [Playtesting](/mapping#playtesting) section for instructions.
{.is-danger}

## BeatSaver
BeatSaver is the public repository for all custom Beat Saber maps. Songs must be in the 2.0 song format (files are .dat and .egg) to be compatible. To release a map:

1. [Create an account](https://beatsaver.com/auth/register) on BeatSaver.
2. Click the “Upload” button in the top-right nav bar.
3. Add your BeatSaver map name and map description. Only the map name is searchable so be sure to include song name, song artist, and other terms that might make it easier to find your map.
>Use “tags” like (Chroma), (OneSaber), or (Mapping Extensions) if your map uses some special modifications or characteristics you want to highlight.
{.is-info}
4. Add your .zip file and click “Upload.”

>Map files cannot currently be updated on BeatSaver. If you need to upload a new version of your map you will need to delete the old one and re-post.
{.is-warning}

## BeastSaber
[BeastSaber](http://www.bsaber.com) is a song review and curation site with a social side for member profiles, forums, news, and tutorials. All songs published on BeatSaver are mirrored to BeastSaber within 10-15 minutes.
