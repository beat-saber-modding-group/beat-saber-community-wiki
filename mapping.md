> Take these guides with a grain of salt! They're not the holy bible of mapping - a lot of these are still opinions. Not everyone's shares the same vocabulary either (what on earth is "drumsticking"?) My advice is to follow these rules until you're comfortable with your skills, and then get creative, experiment and innovate!

## Ranking Criteria
Maps that are ranked and worth PP need to adhere to the [ScoreSaber Ranking Critera](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mtVihRO1LomyptXayoDNDTQYgX_TQPp6ZYDmtwR2jMI/edit). To learn more about the ranking process, visit the [ScoreSaber Discord](https://discord.gg/WpuDMwU).

# Official Editor 
The official editor is developed and supported by Beat Games and pre-installed with the Steam VR or Oculus PC versions of the game. It makes playtesting very convenient with one-click access to your work-in-progress in-game. The official editor is 2D and requires good visualization skills to translate well to a 3D play space, which can be challenging for new mappers. The vast majority of mappers use a [Community Editor](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping#community-editors).

* **To access:** Launch the editor from within Beat Saber in your HMD or use fpfc launch parameters to open directly from your PC
* Megalon's [Official Editor Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ex6sOEVgrM){.youtube}
# Community Editors
Community editors are often a source of innovation with a lot of beneficial quality of life features for mappers, and can be used by mappers without VR. However, they may also be incomplete, unstable, or unpredictable at times so use with caution.

## BeatMapper.app
A new web-based 3D beat saber editor using the new 2.0 song format. Runs in the browser so it's platform agnostic. [BeatMapper Website](https://beatmapper.app/)

## EditSaber Enhanced
An older 3D map editor using the old 1.0 song format (maps must be converted before being playable). [EditSaber Enhanced Download](https://github.com/permissionBRICK/EditSaberEnhanced/releases)

# Playtesting
Testing your work is a critical part of mapping. Playing your own maps as you work helps you adjust for major playability issues and get a feel for your map. Third-party or “outside” playtesting is when someone other than yourself tests your pre-release map and provides constructive feedback.
>You **do not** need to upload your map to Beat Saver in order for you or anyone else to test.
{.is-warning}

* If your map is using the 1.0 song format (your files are .json and .ogg) you must convert your map using one of several available tools like [Songe Converter](https://github.com/lolPants/songe-converter) by lolPants or [BeatMapper Tools](https://beatmappertools.com/index.php) by Darkuni.
* If your map is using the 2.0 song format (your files are .dat and .egg) you’re ready to test.

## Testing on a PC
Follow these steps to test any of your maps made with a community editor using PC-based VR.

1. If your WIP song folder isn’t already in Beat Saber_Data\CustomWIPLevels then place a copy there.
2. Access your map in-game via the CustomWIPLevels category in the bottom song pack menu.

## Testing on a Quest
Follow these steps to test any of your maps made with a community editor using an Oculus Quest. You must have [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com) and [BeatOn](https://bsaber.com/beaton/) installed.

1. Create a compressed .zip file of the individual song files (not the song folder).
2. Drag and drop the .zip file onto the BeatOn upload window.
3. Click “Sync to Beat Saber.”
4. Access your map in-game via the CustomWIPLevels category in the bottom song pack menu.

## Outside Testing
The #testplays channel in the Beat Saber Modding Group discord makes it easy to have your work checked by knowledgeable mappers. Playtesters will provide constructive feedback on how to improve your map in either video or text format in the #mapping-discussion channel.

1. Create a compressed .zip file of the individual song files (not the song folder).
2. Upload your map to #testplays using the following format:
**Map:** The name and artist of your map
**Length:** The length of the song
**BPM:** The BPM of the song
**Difficulty:** Which difficulties are included
**Feedback:** Any requests for feedback (specific difficulties to be tested, things to look for etc.)
**Status:** What state is the map in? (i.e., First draft complete, no lights; 1:45 mapped; release candidate w/ lighting; etc.)
3. Testers will usually look at your map within 24-48 hours and will use a number of reaction emojis (listed in #testplays pinned posts) to track testing status.
# Publishing Songs
One your song has been mapped, lighted, and playtested and it’s a finished product you’re ready to release it to the world on [BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com).

>Please **do not** upload an incomplete WIP map to BeatSaver. Anyone who plays your WIP without practice mode will create a new leaderboard for that map. See the [Playtesting](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping#playtesting) section for instructions.

## BeatSaver
BeatSaver is the public repository for all custom Beat Saber maps. Songs must be in the 2.0 song format (files are .dat and .egg) to be compatible. To release a map:

1. [Create an account](https://beatsaver.com/auth/register) on BeatSaver.
2. Click the “Upload” button in the top-right nav bar.
3. Add your BeatSaver map name and map description. Only the map name is searchable so be sure to include song name, song artist, and other terms that might make it easier to find your map.
>Use “tags” like (Chroma), (OneSaber), or (Mapping Extensions) if your map uses some special modifications or characteristics you want to highlight.
{.is-info}
4. Add your .zip file and click “Upload.”

>Map files cannot currently be updated on BeatSaver. If you need to upload a new version of your map you will need to delete the old one and re-post.
{.is-warning}

## BeastSaber
[BeastSaber](http://www.bsaber.com) is a song review and curation site with a social side for member profiles, forums, news, and tutorials. All songs published on BeatSaver are mirrored to BeastSaber within 10-15 minutes.

# "Mappers" role on the Beat Saber Modding Group Discord
If you'd like to apply for the Mappers role on the Beat Saber Modding Group Discord, use the following google form.
https://goo.gl/forms/KM71UKjQpbCesWNg2
You will be contacted when your application is looked at, but due to the limited staff and higher priority tasks to get to, the wait could be long.

# Frequently Asked Questions
## Do I need Beat Saber installed to use the editors?
Offical editor, yes. Community editors, no. MediocreMapper will ask for the Beat Saber directory, but it can be any folder.

## What if I want to make my own editor / converter?
Take a look at the SongCore documentation on [Kyle 1413's GitHub](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/SongCore)

## Where are custom maps saved?
Custom maps are read from the `Beat Saber/Beat Saber_Data/CustomLevels` folder in your Beat Saber install folder. If your song isn't complete, place it in `CustomWIPLevels` to prevent custom leaderboards from being made for it.
**Where is Beat Saber installed?** See [install folder.](faq/install-folder)

## "Your audio file name is wrong" message in the editor
The 3D Editor only supports `.ogg` files. You have to convert your file to Ogg Vorbis using a converter, such as [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).
If you simply change the file extension to `.ogg`, it will not work.

## How do I delay a song so that it doesn't start right when the level loads?
Currently this isn't possible in Beat Saber or the editors. For now you have to edit the song in an audio editor *(such as Audacity)* to add silence at the beginning of the track.
Check out [Kolezan's Song/Audio Editing Guide](https://bsaber.com/custom-mapping-song-audio-editing/) for instructions.

## I'm having issues uploading the map to BeatSaver, it says the format is invalid but everything looks right.
If you have Windows file extensions turned off, then you might have unknowingly saved your files with names like `cover.jpg.jpg`.  To turn off file extensions in Windows, see the following image:
![File Extensions](/uploads/images/file-extensions.png "File Extensions")

## I want to double the BPM of my song, is there an easy way to do that?
Here is a [Python3 Script](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/442372806705938434/447910905972523008/beat-saber-time-multiplier.zip) that will multiply the BPM and `_time` values in your JSON file by any given factor.
